# Medical-Charges-Analysis

This project is to predict what factors affect the medical charges and then predicting the medical charges using different variables using simple regression techniques.While using our data for regression tests both linear and multiple linear, we see which variables affect the medical cost and which do not. Using the Medical Cost Personal database, we discover that the variables age and bmi are continuous variables; the variables sex, smoker and region are categorical variables. With the help of statistics we see that there’re no variables missing from the database. By running through each variable it will help us interpret the model later down the line to see which variables affect the medical costs. During this process we might encounter problems with the categorical variables. 


#### Medical Cost Personal Dataset 
This data is taken from Kaagle  which was primarily collected by Brent Lantz for his book "Machine Learning with R" which was later made public.

#### Variables information:

1.Age: the age of the insured (recipients).
2.Sex: sex of insured persons; “male” or “female”.
3.bmi: body mass index, providing an understanding of the body, relatively high or low weights relative to height,
4.children: number of children covered by health insurance / number of dependents.
5.smoker: does the insured smoke or not.
6.region: the recipient’s residential area in the United States; northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
7.charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

We can see that the varibles Sex,Smoker,Children and Region seems to be categorical.
